My name is Jason. I'm 25 years old. I have an amazing wife, two young daughters, and two small dogs. By day, I am an engineer at [Schweitzer Engineering Labs][SEL].  By night, I'm an [electrical engineering](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/) graduate student in communication and information theory at [Washington State University][WSU].  In the distant future, I hope do research and possibly teach.

On the rare occasion I have free time, I enjoy playing guitar, spending time with my family, reading sci-fi, and exploring [Linux][].

For a bit more professional or academic information on me, check out my [school website][], though it's a bit sparse at the moment.  My wife and I also share a [family blog][].

## About This Site ##

This is my personal blog, giving me a place to talk about my interests, blow off steam, and have some fun. 

The site is hosted on [Linode][], using [Arch Linux][].

I compose this blog with [Vim][], manage its code with [git][], and generate the site with [Jekyll][]. The style is based on the [Octopress][] framework. The [source code][] for the site is freely available.

The original site design was heavily inspired by similar blogs setup up by [Tate Johnson][], [Raoul Felix][], and [Jack Moffitt][] who generously expose their site's code to the world, to the benefit of lesser coders like me.
