My name is Jason. I have an amazing wife, two young daughters, and two small dogs. By day, I am an engineer at [Schweitzer Engineering Labs][SEL].  By night, I'm an [electrical engineering](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/) graduate student in communication and information theory at [Washington State University][WSU].  In the distant future, I hope do research and possibly teach.

On the rare occasion I have free time, I enjoy playing guitar, spending time with my family, reading sci-fi, and exploring [Linux][].
