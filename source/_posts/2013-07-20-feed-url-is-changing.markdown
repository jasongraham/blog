I interrupt your usual reading to bring you this public service announcement.

According to Feedburner, there do appear to be at least a couple people who
subscribe to his blog via RSS.  For those of you who would like to continue to
do so, please update your readers to fetch from 
[http://jason.the-graham.com/atom.xml](http://jason.the-graham.com/atom.xml)
rather than the current Feedburner URL.  While the Feedburner URL will
continue to work in the immediate future, I expect that in a few months I will
discontinue to use this service.

Thank you.
