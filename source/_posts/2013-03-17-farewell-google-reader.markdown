Google has [announced][closing Reader] that they are closing Google Reader.
This is quite sad for me: Reader is (in my opinion) the best feed reader
available at the moment, and one of the only reasons my wife and I have
a Google account in the first place.

I'm sure that Google realizes that their main service doesn't require a log in
to use ... but without logging in, we produce less valuable metrics for them
to sell ads.

I'm sure that Gmail is too profitable for them to consider it now, but if they
ever get rid of it, there won't be any reason for my wife and I, at least, to
log in.
