My wife and I enjoyed our first wedding anniversary on [Whidbey Island][] this last week.  We stayed at a [cute house with a view][], and enjoyed going hiking at Forts [Casey][] and [Ebey][], seeing the animals at the [Woodland Park Zoo][], and nerding out at the [Pacific Science Center][], among other activities.
